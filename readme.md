100 hours project ----------------------

IDEA: A fitness-dedicated website application, whose main functionality is: When a user searches up (via text box) a muscle group or certain muscle, a menu will pop up and list several different exercises which target that muscle or muscle group. Users can input a muscle group through a search box, or click on a muscle group using the Body Map**.'

1 --- MAIN FUNCTIONALITY ---
    MUSCLE SEARCH: User clicks on a targeted muscle/group on the Body Map** OR searches the muscle/group via input, a list is then generated to show several exercises that target the desired input or click. 



2 --- SECONDARY FUNCTIONALITIES --- 
   1. USER LOGIN: Users can create their own account, along with a log-in landing page. 
   2. BODY MAP: An image of the musculoskelatal system, where users can click on a muscle/group in order to view several exercises that target the desired input (click).
   3. UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE/TIP: Users can choose to upvote or (maybe not) downvote a certain exercise. Users can also add tips to best perform the workout.
   4. PLAYLIST: Users can create a something like a music playlist that saves their saved exercises to a desired playlist name.



3 --- SPECIFICS ---
    1. SEARCH FUNCTION - 
        - Users can use keywords such as "leg", "bicep", "lat" to unlock exercises in the POP-OUT MENU**.
        - Search function allows for checkbox'd filters such as "cable", "compound movement", "dumbbell". Filter starts out as empty and can be filled in.
        - Using the SEARCH FUNCTION** will move the BODY MAP** to its corresponding muscle/group.
        - Will include a click, or "enter" key press to begin search function.
