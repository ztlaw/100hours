100 hours project ----------------------

IDEA: A fitness-dedicated website application, whose main functionality is: When a user searches up (via text box) a muscle group or certain muscle, a menu will pop up and list several different exercises which target that muscle or muscle group. Users can input a muscle group through a search box, or click on a muscle group using the Body Map**.'



1 --- MAIN FUNCTIONALITY ---


    MUSCLE SEARCH: User clicks on a targeted muscle/group on the Body Map** OR searches the muscle/group via input, a list is then generated to show several exercises that target the desired input or click. 



2 --- SECONDARY FUNCTIONALITIES --- 


    1. USER LOGIN: Users can create their own account, along with a log-in landing page. 

    2. BODY MAP: An image of the musculoskelatal system, where users can click on a muscle/group in order to view several exercises that target the desired input (click).

    3. UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE/TIP: Users can choose to upvote or (maybe not) downvote a certain exercise. Users can also add tips to best perform the workout.

    4. PLAYLIST: Users can create a something like a music playlist that saves their saved exercises to a desired playlist name.

    1. SEARCH FUNCTION - 
        - Users can use keywords such as "leg", "bicep", "lat" to unlock exercises in the POP-OUT MENU**.

        - Will include a click, or "enter" key press to begin search function.
    
    2. BODY MAP - (This will probably be the most complex)
        - BODY MAP is an interactive map of the body's musculoskeletal system, with labels for all the muscles/groups.
        - Musculoskeletal body (ideally in a T-pose) can be dragged in a horizonal 360 degree position.
        - Can be slightly zoomed in an out using the scroll wheel
        - Map can be dragged by holding the left-click.
        - On click, the desired muscle/group will be toggled with a red highlight. 

    3. POP-OUT MENU - 
        - POP-OUT MENU is the large, scrollable menu that pops out onto the right side of the screen and lists out the multiple exercises within the desired muscle/group. 
        - Menu pops up when the muscle group is clicked in the BODY MAP or searched in the SEARCH FUNCTION.
        - Menu can be closed, opened, or minimized. 
        - The top of the Menu shows the searched muscle/group, along with desired filters(FIXED POSITION)
        - Under the top, shows the scrollable window that lists each exercise, in a descending order by popularity.

    4. USER ACCOUNTS -
        - Users can save WORKOUTS with the click of a "+" sign at the top right.
